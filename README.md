# Research-on-Optimal-Forest-Cutting-Strategy-based-on-BP-Neural-Network-Algorithm
A project for American College Student Mathematical Modeling Competition 2022.
Collected the data on forest carbon dioxide cycle and tree harvesting in The Great Khingan Mountains of China.
Built a carbon sequestration evaluation model using MOLP, Principal Component Analysis and measured it with predictions 
from GM(1, 1) model and BP NN, then put forward suggestions for local carbon cycle and forest utilization and protection.
